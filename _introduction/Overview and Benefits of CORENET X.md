Harnessing the power of digitalisation and technology, CORENET X will allow Qualified Persons (QPs, i.e.
professional engineers and registered architects) to submit a three-dimensional model of a development or
building - created and developed digitally through Building Information Modelling (BIM) - to the regulatory
agencies.
It allows the project team, which includes the QPs, to collaborate and review their designs in the model
together, detect possible major conflicts before construction, and produce a coordinated BIM model for
submission and regulatory approval. It changes the current practice of QPs dealing separately with multiple
regulatory agencies, and producing different versions of building plans thereafter.
Led by BCA and URA, CORENET X was developed in close collaboration with the other regulatory agencies
and leading built environment professionals, firms and Trade Associations and Chambers (TACs). It is slated
for implementation by the end of 2023.
